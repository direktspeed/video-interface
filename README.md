# video-interface
Is a Application for Video Creation and Streaming works well with OBS Studio and other Screen Capture Software.


## Why?
We needed a Flexible way to Compose Videos out of Many Sources and the Obs Interface did not meet our needs so we choosen to Provide our Own Screen Composition Software so That we can control what gets showed.



# Use Cases
Live Streaming with one or more sources that need individual control.


# For Obs Interop
- we use obs websocket
